-appendToFile <localsrc> ... <dst> :
  Appends the contents of all the given local files to the given dst file. The dst
  file will be created if it does not exist. If <localSrc> is -, then the input is
  read from stdin.

-cat [-ignoreCrc] <src> ... :
  Fetch all files that match the file pattern <src> and display their content on
  stdout.

-checksum <src> ... :
  Dump checksum information for files that match the file pattern <src> to stdout.
  Note that this requires a round-trip to a datanode storing each block of the
  file, and thus is not efficient to run on a large number of files. The checksum
  of a file depends on its content, block size and the checksum algorithm and
  parameters used for creating the file.

-chgrp [-R] GROUP PATH... :
  This is equivalent to -chown ... :GROUP ...

-chmod [-R] <MODE[,MODE]... | OCTALMODE> PATH... :
  Changes permissions of a file. This works similar to the shell's chmod command
  with a few exceptions.
                                                                                 
  -R           modifies the files recursively. This is the only option currently 
               supported.                                                        
  <MODE>       Mode is the same as mode used for the shell's command. The only   
               letters recognized are 'rwxXt', e.g. +t,a+r,g-w,+rwx,o=r.         
  <OCTALMODE>  Mode specifed in 3 or 4 digits. If 4 digits, the first may be 1 or
               0 to turn the sticky bit on or off, respectively.  Unlike the     
               shell command, it is not possible to specify only part of the     
               mode, e.g. 754 is same as u=rwx,g=rx,o=r.                         
  
  If none of 'augo' is specified, 'a' is assumed and unlike the shell command, no
  umask is applied.

-chown [-R] [OWNER][:[GROUP]] PATH... :
  Changes owner and group of a file. This is similar to the shell's chown command
  with a few exceptions.
                                                                                 
  -R  modifies the files recursively. This is the only option currently          
      supported.                                                                 
  
  If only the owner or group is specified, then only the owner or group is
  modified. The owner and group names may only consist of digits, alphabet, and
  any of [-_./@a-zA-Z0-9]. The names are case sensitive.
  
  WARNING: Avoid using '.' to separate user name and group though Linux allows it.
  If user names have dots in them and you are using local file system, you might
  see surprising results since the shell command 'chown' is used for local files.

-copyFromLocal [-f] [-p] [-l] <localsrc> ... <dst> :
  Identical to the -put command.

-copyToLocal [-p] [-ignoreCrc] [-crc] <src> ... <localdst> :
  Identical to the -get command.

-count [-q] [-h] [-v] [-t [<storage type>]] [-u] <path> ... :
  Count the number of directories, files and bytes under the paths
  that match the specified file pattern.  The output columns are:
  DIR_COUNT FILE_COUNT CONTENT_SIZE PATHNAME
  or, with the -q option:
  QUOTA REM_QUOTA SPACE_QUOTA REM_SPACE_QUOTA
        DIR_COUNT FILE_COUNT CONTENT_SIZE PATHNAME
  The -h option shows file sizes in human readable format.
  The -v option displays a header line.
  The -t option displays quota by storage types.
  It must be used with -q option.
  If a comma-separated list of storage types is given after the -t option, 
  it displays the quota and usage for the specified types. 
  Otherwise, it displays the quota and usage for all the storage 
  types that support quota 
  The -u option shows the quota and 
  the usage against the quota without the detailed content summary.

-cp [-f] [-p | -p[topax]] <src> ... <dst> :
  Copy files that match the file pattern <src> to a destination.  When copying
  multiple files, the destination must be a directory. Passing -p preserves status
  [topax] (timestamps, ownership, permission, ACLs, XAttr). If -p is specified
  with no <arg>, then preserves timestamps, ownership, permission. If -pa is
  specified, then preserves permission also because ACL is a super-set of
  permission. Passing -f overwrites the destination if it already exists. raw
  namespace extended attributes are preserved if (1) they are supported (HDFS
  only) and, (2) all of the source and target pathnames are in the /.reserved/raw
  hierarchy. raw namespace xattr preservation is determined solely by the presence
  (or absence) of the /.reserved/raw prefix and not by the -p option.

-createSnapshot <snapshotDir> [<snapshotName>] :
  Create a snapshot on a directory

-deleteSnapshot <snapshotDir> <snapshotName> :
  Delete a snapshot from a directory

-df [-h] [<path> ...] :
  Shows the capacity, free and used space of the filesystem. If the filesystem has
  multiple partitions, and no path to a particular partition is specified, then
  the status of the root partitions will be shown.
                                                                                 
  -h  Formats the sizes of files in a human-readable fashion rather than a number
      of bytes.                                                                  

-du [-s] [-h] <path> ... :
  Show the amount of space, in bytes, used by the files that match the specified
  file pattern. The following flags are optional:
                                                                                 
  -s  Rather than showing the size of each individual file that matches the      
      pattern, shows the total (summary) size.                                   
  -h  Formats the sizes of files in a human-readable fashion rather than a number
      of bytes.                                                                  
  
  Note that, even without the -s option, this only shows size summaries one level
  deep into a directory.
  
  The output is in the form 
        size    name(full path)

-expunge :
  Delete files from the trash that are older than the retention threshold

-find <path> ... <expression> ... :
  Finds all files that match the specified expression and
  applies selected actions to them. If no <path> is specified
  then defaults to the current working directory. If no
  expression is specified then defaults to -print.
  
  The following primary expressions are recognised:
    -name pattern
    -iname pattern
      Evaluates as true if the basename of the file matches the
      pattern using standard file system globbing.
      If -iname is used then the match is case insensitive.
  
    -print
    -print0
      Always evaluates to true. Causes the current pathname to be
      written to standard output followed by a newline. If the -print0
      expression is used then an ASCII NULL character is appended rather
      than a newline.
  
  The following operators are recognised:
    expression -a expression
    expression -and expression
    expression expression
      Logical AND operator for joining two expressions. Returns
      true if both child expressions return true. Implied by the
      juxtaposition of two expressions and so does not need to be
      explicitly specified. The second expression will not be
      applied if the first fails.

-get [-p] [-ignoreCrc] [-crc] <src> ... <localdst> :
  Copy files that match the file pattern <src> to the local name.  <src> is kept. 
  When copying multiple files, the destination must be a directory. Passing -p
  preserves access and modification times, ownership and the mode.

-getfacl [-R] <path> :
  Displays the Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and directories. If a
  directory has a default ACL, then getfacl also displays the default ACL.
                                                                  
  -R      List the ACLs of all files and directories recursively. 
  <path>  File or directory to list.                              

-getfattr [-R] {-n name | -d} [-e en] <path> :
  Displays the extended attribute names and values (if any) for a file or
  directory.
                                                                                 
  -R             Recursively list the attributes for all files and directories.  
  -n name        Dump the named extended attribute value.                        
  -d             Dump all extended attribute values associated with pathname.    
  -e <encoding>  Encode values after retrieving them.Valid encodings are "text", 
                 "hex", and "base64". Values encoded as text strings are enclosed
                 in double quotes ("), and values encoded as hexadecimal and     
                 base64 are prefixed with 0x and 0s, respectively.               
  <path>         The file or directory.                                          

-getmerge [-nl] <src> <localdst> :
  Get all the files in the directories that match the source file pattern and
  merge and sort them to only one file on local fs. <src> is kept.
                                                        
  -nl  Add a newline character at the end of each file. 

-help [cmd ...] :
  Displays help for given command or all commands if none is specified.

-ls [-C] [-d] [-h] [-q] [-R] [-t] [-S] [-r] [-u] [<path> ...] :
  List the contents that match the specified file pattern. If path is not
  specified, the contents of /user/<currentUser> will be listed. For a directory a
  list of its direct children is returned (unless -d option is specified).
  
  Directory entries are of the form:
        permissions - userId groupId sizeOfDirectory(in bytes)
  modificationDate(yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm) directoryName
  
  and file entries are of the form:
        permissions numberOfReplicas userId groupId sizeOfFile(in bytes)
  modificationDate(yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm) fileName
  
    -C  Display the paths of files and directories only.
    -d  Directories are listed as plain files.
    -h  Formats the sizes of files in a human-readable fashion
        rather than a number of bytes.
    -q  Print ? instead of non-printable characters.
    -R  Recursively list the contents of directories.
    -t  Sort files by modification time (most recent first).
    -S  Sort files by size.
    -r  Reverse the order of the sort.
    -u  Use time of last access instead of modification for
        display and sorting.

-mkdir [-p] <path> ... :
  Create a directory in specified location.
                                                  
  -p  Do not fail if the directory already exists 

-moveFromLocal <localsrc> ... <dst> :
  Same as -put, except that the source is deleted after it's copied.

-moveToLocal <src> <localdst> :
  Not implemented yet

-mv <src> ... <dst> :
  Move files that match the specified file pattern <src> to a destination <dst>. 
  When moving multiple files, the destination must be a directory.

-put [-f] [-p] [-l] <localsrc> ... <dst> :
  Copy files from the local file system into fs. Copying fails if the file already
  exists, unless the -f flag is given.
  Flags:
                                                                       
  -p  Preserves access and modification times, ownership and the mode. 
  -f  Overwrites the destination if it already exists.                 
  -l  Allow DataNode to lazily persist the file to disk. Forces        
         replication factor of 1. This flag will result in reduced
         durability. Use with care.

-renameSnapshot <snapshotDir> <oldName> <newName> :
  Rename a snapshot from oldName to newName

-rm [-f] [-r|-R] [-skipTrash] [-safely] <src> ... :
  Delete all files that match the specified file pattern. Equivalent to the Unix
  command "rm <src>"
                                                                                 
  -f          If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or 
              modify the exit status to reflect an error.                        
  -[rR]       Recursively deletes directories.                                   
  -skipTrash  option bypasses trash, if enabled, and immediately deletes <src>.  
  -safely     option requires safety confirmation, if enabled, requires          
              confirmation before deleting large directory with more than        
              <hadoop.shell.delete.limit.num.files> files. Delay is expected when
              walking over large directory recursively to count the number of    
              files to be deleted before the confirmation.                       

-rmdir [--ignore-fail-on-non-empty] <dir> ... :
  Removes the directory entry specified by each directory argument, provided it is
  empty.

-setfacl [-R] [{-b|-k} {-m|-x <acl_spec>} <path>]|[--set <acl_spec> <path>] :
  Sets Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and directories.
  Options:
                                                                                 
  -b          Remove all but the base ACL entries. The entries for user, group   
              and others are retained for compatibility with permission bits.    
  -k          Remove the default ACL.                                            
  -R          Apply operations to all files and directories recursively.         
  -m          Modify ACL. New entries are added to the ACL, and existing entries 
              are retained.                                                      
  -x          Remove specified ACL entries. Other ACL entries are retained.      
  --set       Fully replace the ACL, discarding all existing entries. The        
              <acl_spec> must include entries for user, group, and others for    
              compatibility with permission bits.                                
  <acl_spec>  Comma separated list of ACL entries.                               
  <path>      File or directory to modify.                                       

-setfattr {-n name [-v value] | -x name} <path> :
  Sets an extended attribute name and value for a file or directory.
                                                                                 
  -n name   The extended attribute name.                                         
  -v value  The extended attribute value. There are three different encoding     
            methods for the value. If the argument is enclosed in double quotes, 
            then the value is the string inside the quotes. If the argument is   
            prefixed with 0x or 0X, then it is taken as a hexadecimal number. If 
            the argument begins with 0s or 0S, then it is taken as a base64      
            encoding.                                                            
  -x name   Remove the extended attribute.                                       
  <path>    The file or directory.                                               

-setrep [-R] [-w] <rep> <path> ... :
  Set the replication level of a file. If <path> is a directory then the command
  recursively changes the replication factor of all files under the directory tree
  rooted at <path>.
                                                                                 
  -w  It requests that the command waits for the replication to complete. This   
      can potentially take a very long time.                                     
  -R  It is accepted for backwards compatibility. It has no effect.              

-stat [format] <path> ... :
  Print statistics about the file/directory at <path>
  in the specified format. Format accepts filesize in
  blocks (%b), type (%F), group name of owner (%g),
  name (%n), block size (%o), replication (%r), user name
  of owner (%u), modification date (%y, %Y).
  %y shows UTC date as "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" and
  %Y shows milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.
  If the format is not specified, %y is used by default.

-tail [-f] <file> :
  Show the last 1KB of the file.
                                             
  -f  Shows appended data as the file grows. 

-test -[defsz] <path> :
  Answer various questions about <path>, with result via exit status.
    -d  return 0 if <path> is a directory.
    -e  return 0 if <path> exists.
    -f  return 0 if <path> is a file.
  --set       Fully replace the ACL, discarding all existing entries. The        
    -s  return 0 if file <path> is greater         than zero bytes in size.
    -w  return 0 if file <path> exists         and write permission is granted.
    -r  return 0 if file <path> exists         and read permission is granted.
    -z  return 0 if file <path> is         zero bytes in size, else return 1.
-text [-ignoreCrc] <src> ... :
  Takes a source file and outputs the file in text format.
  The allowed formats are zip and TextRecordInputStream and Avro.
-touchz <path> ... :
  Creates a file of zero length at <path> with current time as the timestamp of
  that <path>. An error is returned if the file exists with non-zero length
-truncate [-w] <length> <path> ... :
  Truncate all files that match the specified file pattern to the specified
  length.
                                                                                 
  -w  Requests that the command wait for block recovery to complete, if          
      necessary.                                                                 
-usage [cmd ...] :
  Displays the usage for given command or all commands if none is specified.
Generic options supported are
-conf <configuration file>     specify an application configuration file
-D <property=value>            use value for given property
-fs <local|namenode:port>      specify a namenode
