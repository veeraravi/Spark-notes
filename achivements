1. Kafka, Streaming, and Real-Time Data Pipelines

I designed and implemented Structured Streaming pipelines integrated with Kafka to enable scalable, real-time data ingestion.

I helped Nishant with connecting and reading data from Kafka in a local environment, accelerating early-stage development and troubleshooting.

I investigated and resolved Kafka data loss issues in production by proposing multiple solutions such as partitioning by timestamp and parallel job execution.

I fixed issues related to null messages, duplicate runs, and SSL certificate expiration, ensuring stable and reliable Kafka-to-BigQuery data pipelines.

2. BigQuery Migration, Schema Evolution, and Processing

I contributed to the design and development of GCP migration into BigQuery, improving data availability and analytics capabilities.

I collaborated with Lalitha on BigQuery schema evolution, validating schema changes and resolving compatibility issues.

I implemented dynamic table creation logic to auto-create BigQuery tables when they do not exist and resolved MapType compatibility issues.

I enhanced schema evolution handling for streaming pipelines and validated ingestion with multiple file formats, including Avro, Parquet, Excel, and Fixed-width.

3. Code Quality, Refactoring, and Development Support

I supported Panneer with code refactoring to address SonarQube issues, improving code quality, maintainability, and compliance.

I worked with Dharmendra on Iceberg code changes, optimizing table performance and storage efficiency.

I participated in multiple code reviews, merged production fixes, and contributed to reusable and modular code components.

4. Pub/Sub, Audit, and Monitoring Enhancements

I implemented job-level audit summary publishing to Pub/Sub for CDM Nxt.

I completed end-to-end Kafka testing (producer/consumer) and supported GDW sandbox onboarding.

I enhanced logging and monitoring, resolved post-deployment issues, and improved pipeline observability and reliability.

5. Cross-System Integrations and Issue Resolution

I supported CDM Nxt production issues by enabling and troubleshooting connectivity with Teradata.

I worked on DC-exit testing, handled certificate renewal, and prepared documentation for GCP Kafka ingestion.

I participated in schema evolution validation for both direct and indirect write scenarios in BigQuery.

6. Collaboration and Team Enablement

I supported Ayush, Nishant, and Roshni in development and testing activities, enabling faster delivery and smooth collaboration.

I worked closely with Ashok, Rahul, Sunil, and the KEES team to resolve issues related to schema registry, SSL, and Kafka integration.

I closed multiple Kanban tickets (HDDCTS series), removed blockers, and contributed to maintaining sprint velocity.

‚úÖ What Went Well

I successfully delivered end-to-end Kafka ‚Üí BigQuery ‚Üí Pub/Sub pipelines, tested, and stabilized them across environments.

I strengthened cross-team collaboration, resulting in faster issue resolution and accelerated delivery timelines.

I significantly improved code quality through refactoring and Sonar fixes.

I enabled ingestion pipelines to support multiple file formats with seamless schema evolution.

I laid a strong foundation for future scalability through GCP migration design and structured streaming architecture.

‚≠ê What Stands Out

I demonstrated strong ownership and problem-solving skills by tackling complex issues such as data loss, SSL, and schema registry errors.

I showed future-focused design thinking by implementing structured streaming, Iceberg integration, and multi-format ingestion.

I exhibited cross-functional leadership by supporting multiple teammates and collaborating across domains including Kafka, BigQuery, and Teradata.

I maintained a focus on end-to-end delivery, from ingestion and transformation to audit logging and production support.
