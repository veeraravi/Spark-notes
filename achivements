üåü Weekly Accomplishments
‚úÖ Kafka, Streaming, and Real-Time Data Pipelines
‚Ä¢	Designed and implemented Structured Streaming pipelines integrated with Kafka for scalable, real-time data ingestion.
‚Ä¢	Helped Nishant with connecting and reading data from Kafka in a local environment, accelerating early-stage development and debugging.
‚Ä¢	Investigated and resolved Kafka data loss issues in production, providing multiple solution approaches including partitioning by timestamp and parallel job execution.
‚Ä¢	Fixed issues with null messages, duplicate runs, and SSL certificate expiration, ensuring stable Kafka-to-BigQuery data flow.
‚úÖ BigQuery Migration, Schema Evolution, and Processing
‚Ä¢	Contributed to the design and development of GCP migration to BigQuery, improving data availability and analytics capabilities.
‚Ä¢	Collaborated with Lalitha on BigQuery schema evolution, validating schema changes and resolving compatibility issues.
‚Ä¢	Implemented dynamic table creation logic to auto-create tables in BigQuery if they don‚Äôt exist and resolved MapType compatibility issues.
‚Ä¢	Enhanced schema evolution handling for streaming pipelines and tested multiple ingestion formats (Avro, Parquet, Excel, Fixed-width).
‚úÖ Code Quality, Refactoring & Collaboration
‚Ä¢	Supported Panneer with code refactoring efforts to resolve SonarQube issues, improving code quality and maintainability.
‚Ä¢	Worked with Dharmendra on Iceberg code changes, enhancing table performance and storage efficiency.
‚Ä¢	Participated in multiple PR reviews, merged production fixes, and contributed to reusable code components.
‚úÖ Pub/Sub, Audit, and Monitoring
‚Ä¢	Implemented job-level audit summary publishing to Pub/Sub for CDM Nxt.
‚Ä¢	Completed E2E Kafka testing (producer/consumer) and GDW sandbox onboarding.
‚Ä¢	Fixed post-deployment issues, improved logging/monitoring, and enhanced pipeline observability.
‚úÖ Cross-System Integrations & Issue Resolution
‚Ä¢	Supported CDM Nxt production issues by troubleshooting and enabling connectivity with Teradata.
‚Ä¢	Worked on DC-exit testing and certificate renewal tasks.
‚Ä¢	Participated in schema evolution validation for direct vs. indirect writes in BigQuery and prepared documentation for GCP Kafka ingestion.
‚úÖ Collaboration & Team Support
‚Ä¢	Supported teammates ‚Äì Ayush, Nishant, and Roshni ‚Äì across various development and testing tasks, enabling faster delivery and knowledge sharing.
‚Ä¢	Worked closely with Ashok, Rahul, Sunil, and KEES team on key issues such as schema registry, SSL, and Kafka integration.
‚Ä¢	Closed numerous Kanban tickets (HDDCTS series), removed blockers, and accelerated sprint velocity.

üìà What Went Well
‚Ä¢	End-to-end pipelines from Kafka ‚Üí BigQuery ‚Üí Pub/Sub were successfully tested and stabilized.
‚Ä¢	Collaboration across multiple teams led to quicker troubleshooting and accelerated delivery.
‚Ä¢	Code quality improved significantly through refactoring and Sonar fixes.
‚Ä¢	Real-time and batch pipelines now support multiple ingestion formats and schema evolution seamlessly.
‚Ä¢	Contributions in GCP migration design and structured streaming architecture laid a strong foundation for future scalability.

üèÜ What Stands Out
‚Ä¢	Strong ownership and problem-solving mindset: Tackled complex data loss, SSL, and schema registry issues with multiple solution paths.
‚Ä¢	Future-focused design thinking: Structured streaming, Iceberg integration, and multi-format ingestion demonstrate strategic foresight.
‚Ä¢	Cross-functional leadership: Supported multiple teammates (Panneer, Dharmendra, Lalitha, Ayush, Nishant, Roshni) and collaborated across domains (Kafka, BigQuery, Teradata).
‚Ä¢	End-to-end delivery focus: From design and development to testing, deployment, and post-prod issue resolution.
