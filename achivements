Going forward, I want to focus on strengthening my leadership impact by expanding both my technical depth and strategic influence. A key priority is to deepen my expertise in real-time data processing and streaming architectures — particularly around Kafka, Structured Streaming, and BigQuery optimization — to design solutions that are not only scalable and performant but also aligned with long-term business goals.

I also aim to play a more active role in solution architecture and design discussions, driving initiatives such as GCP migrations, Iceberg adoption, advanced schema evolution strategies, and high-performance ingestion pipelines. This will position me to influence technical direction and guide end-to-end solution delivery at an enterprise level.

Another key area of focus is accelerating my learning and application of Generative AI and agentic AI to explore how intelligent agents and LLM-driven automation can enhance data engineering workflows, improve decision-making, and unlock new business capabilities.

On the team side, I plan to focus on mentoring and coaching, sharing knowledge with teammates, enabling skill growth, and fostering a collaborative, innovation-driven culture. By combining deeper technical expertise, AI innovation, and stronger leadership behaviors, I aim to deliver higher strategic value, support organizational goals more holistically, and contribute meaningfully to the company’s evolving data and AI strategy.
