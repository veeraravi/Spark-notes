Risk overlay expectations were consistently met during this period. I proactively identified and mitigated potential risks across multiple stages of the data pipeline â€” including data loss scenarios, schema evolution challenges, SSL certificate expiration, and schema registry connectivity issues. Each issue was addressed promptly through thorough root cause analysis, implementation of corrective actions, and collaboration with cross-functional teams.

I also focused on strengthening preventive measures by improving monitoring, enhancing logging, and introducing validation checks to catch potential failures early. Additionally, I ensured compliance with best practices for data security, governance, and operational reliability, particularly during GCP migration, Kafka integration, and BigQuery deployments.

Looking ahead, I plan to further integrate automated risk detection and leverage GenAI-driven anomaly detection capabilities to proactively identify and address risks before they impact production.
